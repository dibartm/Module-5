### Module-5
This project consists of several tasks to analyze and visualize data related to a study on the effects of different drug regimens on mice. Here's a brief summary of each task:

Prepare the data: Combine two dataframes, check for duplicate mouse IDs, and create a cleaned dataframe for further analysis.
Generate summary statistics: Create a summary statistics dataframe with mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of tumor volume for each drug regimen.
Create bar charts and pie charts: Create two bar charts and two pie charts to visualize the data on drug regimens and gender distribution of mice in the study.
Calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create a box plot: Calculate the final tumor volume of each mouse for four treatment regimens, calculate quartiles and IQR, determine potential outliers, and create a box plot.
Create a line plot and a scatter plot: Generate a line plot of tumor volume versus time point for a mouse treated with Capomulin, and a scatter plot of tumor volume versus mouse weight for the Capomulin treatment regimen.
Calculate correlation and regression: Calculate the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment, and plot the regression model on the scatter plot.
After completing these tasks, submit the final analysis. The project requires the use of Pandas, Matplotlib, and SciPy packages for data analysis and visualization.
